1. Importing OpenCV The code starts by importing the OpenCV library, aliasing it as cv. This allows the use of OpenCV functions and classes with the cv prefix.

2. Loading the Face Detection Classifier The detect_faces function loads a pre-trained face detection classifier using the CascadeClassifier class from OpenCV. The classifier is loaded from the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file, which is a pre-trained model for detecting frontal faces. This file is part of the OpenCV distribution and is located in the haarcascades directory.

3. Capturing Video Frames The code then captures video frames from the default camera (index 0) using the VideoCapture class. The while loop reads frames from the camera until the program is stopped.

4. Converting Frames to Grayscale Each captured frame is converted to grayscale using the cvtColor function. This is done because the face detection classifier is trained on grayscale images.

5. Detecting Faces The detectMultiScale function is used to detect faces in the grayscale frame. This function takes three parameters:
gray: the grayscale frame
scaleFactor=1.3: the scale factor used to detect faces at different sizes
minNeighbors=5: the minimum number of neighboring pixels required to retain a detected face
The function returns a list of detected faces, where each face is represented by a tuple of four values: (x, y, w, h), which represent the top-left corner coordinates and the width and height of the face bounding box.

6. Drawing Face Bounding Boxes The code then iterates over the detected faces and draws a bounding box around each face using the rectangle function. The box is drawn on the original frame with a blue color (RGB: 255, 0, 0) and a thickness of 2 pixels.

7. Displaying the Output The output frame with the drawn bounding boxes is displayed using the imshow function.

8. Waiting for User Input The code waits for the user to press the 'q' key to exit the program using the waitKey function.

9. Releasing resources finally, the code releases the camera and window resources using the release and destroyAllWindows functions.
